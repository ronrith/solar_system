Create a Three.js-based, single-file 3D web app rendering our Solar System with a central Sun and eight orbiting planets, optimized for desktop and mobile via CDN-hosted libraries. It features a responsive WebGL canvas, OrbitControls for touch (swipe-rotate, pinch-zoom) and mouse input, and a dynamic camera with auto-orbit until user override. With vertex-colored planets, a fading star field, and Bloom-enhanced shooting stars, this lean codebase offers engineers a springboard to integrate shaders, physics, or additional geometries using its modular structure.
